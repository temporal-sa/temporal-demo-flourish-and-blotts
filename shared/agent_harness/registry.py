"""Tool registry — maps wire-name → (handler, takes_arg, arg_type).

`register_tool` validates each ToolDef and, when an `impl` is set, adds an
entry to TOOL_HANDLERS. Two ToolDefs may share the same wire-name (e.g.
substitute_item exists in both REPAIR and OPS) as long as the handler
callable is the same — registering a different callable under an existing
name is rejected.

The registry is consumed by:
  * dispatch_tool_activity — the dynamic Temporal activity for tool calls.
  * call_tool_handler — direct in-process callers like
    execute_approved_plan_step that already run inside an activity.
